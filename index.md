# Welcome to the CCSDS MO Software Pages

The Spacecraft Monitoring and Control (SM&C) Working Group of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS), which sees the active participation of 10 space agencies and of the Space Domain Task Force of the Object Management Group (OMG), is defining a service oriented architecture consisting of a set of standard end-to-end services between functions resident on board a spacecraft or based on the ground, that are responsible for mission operations.

This site contains links to sources of information and software that gets you up and running with the MO software standards quickly.
